<h1><center>Boston Air Quality </center></h1>


<p align="justify"> Air pollution is contamination of the environment by any physical, chemical, or biological agent that changes the atmosphere's natural characteristics. The Air Quality Index (AQI), the concentration of pollutants in the air in a specific place, is accepted as an indicator of air pollution. The higher the AQI value means, the greater the level of air pollution and the more considerable the health concern. Forecasting air quality is essential for reducing the damage caused by air pollution to human health. By forecasting air quality,  authorities can take precautions and issue early warnings to reduce the impacts of air pollution. Therefore, in this project I aim to build a time series model to forecast the air quality of Boston.</p>
